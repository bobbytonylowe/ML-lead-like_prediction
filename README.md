# ML-lead-like_prediction
- Machine learning model which predicts whether a compound is Lead-like.
- Key components are molecular weight (RMM), lipophilicity (AlogP), number of aromatic rings and heavy atom count (HAC).
- Although the dataset is of low quantity, the model has a 93% accuracy.


# Model, predict and solve
- This is a classification model used to predict the required solution. 
- Supervised learning technique as the training of the model is with a given dataset. 

# Possible algorithms
- Logistic Regression
- KNN or k-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machines
- Naive Bayes classifier
- Decision Tree
- Random Forrest
- Perceptron
- Artificial neural network
- RVM or Relevance Vector Machine
